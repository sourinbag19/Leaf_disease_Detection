# Leaf_disease_Detection

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases using an augmented image dataset. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is the *New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)*, structured into training and validation directories. The directory structure should look like this:


dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class_1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ class_2/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ valid/
    â”œâ”€â”€ class_1/
    â”œâ”€â”€ class_2/
    â””â”€â”€ ...

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The CNN model includes multiple convolutional, max-pooling, and dropout layers. The architecture increases filter sizes in deeper layers to improve feature extraction.

- *Input shape:* (128, 128, 3)
- *Convolutional layers:* with ReLU activation
- *MaxPooling2D layers*
- *Dropout layers*
- *Final Dense layer:* with softmax activation for multi-class classification

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Pandas
