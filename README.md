# Leaf_disease_Detection

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify plant diseases using an augmented image dataset. The model is trained using TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the *New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)*, structured into training and validation directories. The directory structure should look like this:


dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── class_1/
│   ├── class_2/
│   └── ...
└── valid/
    ├── class_1/
    ├── class_2/
    └── ...

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The CNN model includes multiple convolutional, max-pooling, and dropout layers. The architecture increases filter sizes in deeper layers to improve feature extraction.

- *Input shape:* (128, 128, 3)
- *Convolutional layers:* with ReLU activation
- *MaxPooling2D layers*
- *Dropout layers*
- *Final Dense layer:* with softmax activation for multi-class classification
